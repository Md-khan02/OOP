# Email Simulator

# Overview

This Python-based email simulator is an educational project designed to demonstrate the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It simulates a simple email system where users can read emails, view unread emails, and populate an inbox with sample emails.

# Features

Read Emails: Users can select an email from the inbox to read, which will then mark the email as read.

View Unread Emails: Displays a list of all emails that have not been read yet.

Sample Email Population: At startup, the inbox is populated with three sample emails to interact with.

# Installation

To run the email simulator, you will need Python installed on your computer. This project was developed and tested with Python 3.8, but it should be compatible with most Python 3.x versions.

Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Md-khan02/OOP/blob/main/email.py

Navigate to the cloned directory:

bash
Copy code
cd email-simulator
Run the program:

Copy code
python email.py

# Usage

Upon running the program, you will be presented with a menu to choose from reading an email, viewing unread emails, or quitting the application. Select an option by entering the corresponding number:

Read an email: Enter 1 and press Enter. Follow the prompts to select an email to read.

View unread emails: Enter 2 and press Enter to see a list of unread emails.

Quit application: Enter 3 and press Enter to exit the program.
